# Functions

## Need to Know


A `fuction` is created/called by doing 
```javascript

function doSomething(){ var action= x+1};

```
When you call a function, use camelCase, parentheses and a semicolon: doSomething();

```javascript

var x = function(){}

````



A function can accept things called parameters which are passed in

```javascript

function doSomething(x,y){
}

```

Returning a parameter within a function is done by

```javascript

function doSomething(x){
return x*5;
}

```
Functions can contain things such as `for` and `if` which are called by
```javascript

function doSomething(x){
for(i=0;i<100;i++){
x+random
  }
}

```

Calling a function is simple. After defining the function, you call it by doing

```javascript

doSomething();

```
# Closures














closures: calling a function with a variable:
 ```javascript
  function myFunc(){
     var c = int(random(0, 255));
     console.log(c);
     }
     
     var colornum = myFunc();
     colornum;
